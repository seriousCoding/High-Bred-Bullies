If Coinbase OAuth2 is not redirecting back to your app after login, here are the possible reasons and solutions:

üõ† Common Causes & Fixes
1Ô∏è‚É£ Incorrect Redirect URI
üîπ Problem:

The redirect URI registered in your Coinbase Developer App must match exactly the one used in your OAuth request.
If they don't match, Coinbase won't redirect back to your app.
‚úÖ Fix:

Go to Coinbase Developer Portal.
Ensure the redirect URI in your app settings matches the one in your OAuth request.
Update your OAuth request URL like this:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
https://www.coinbase.com/oauth/authorize?
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback
&response_type=code
&scope=wallet:user:read
2Ô∏è‚É£ Redirect URI Not Whitelisted
üîπ Problem:

If the redirect URI is not added in the Coinbase Developer App settings, Coinbase won‚Äôt redirect.
‚úÖ Fix:

Add your redirect URI manually in the developer settings:
Go to Coinbase Developer App.
Find your app ‚Üí Edit settings.
Under Redirect URIs, add https://yourapp.com/auth/callback.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Missing or Incorrect Response Type (code)
üîπ Problem:

Coinbase OAuth requires response_type=code.
If it's missing or set incorrectly, the authentication flow may fail.
‚úÖ Fix:
Ensure the URL contains response_type=code:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
https://www.coinbase.com/oauth/authorize?
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback
&response_type=code
&scope=wallet:user:read
4Ô∏è‚É£ Issues with Localhost Redirect (During Development)
üîπ Problem:

Coinbase may not allow http://localhost in production mode.
Some browsers block OAuth redirections to localhost.
‚úÖ Fix:

Use http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/callback instead of http://localhost:5000/auth/callback.
If testing locally, use a tunneling service like ngrok:
sh
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 5000
This gives you a public URL like https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/auth/callback.
Use this in your Coinbase OAuth settings.
5Ô∏è‚É£ User Cancels Login or Coinbase Blocks Redirect
üîπ Problem:

If the user cancels the login, Coinbase might not redirect.
Some browsers block redirects due to security settings.
‚úÖ Fix:

Add error handling in your app:
javascript
Copy
Edit
if (!window.location.href.includes("code=")) {
    console.error("OAuth failed: No authorization code received.");
}
Check Coinbase Logs for any errors:
Go to Coinbase Developer Dashboard ‚Üí Check OAuth errors.
6Ô∏è‚É£ OAuth Token Exchange Fails
üîπ Problem:

If the backend fails to exchange the auth code for an access token, the user may not be redirected properly.
‚úÖ Fix:
Ensure the backend properly exchanges the auth code:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const axios = require("axios");

async function exchangeAuthCode(code) {
    const response = await axios.post("https://www.coinbase.com/oauth/token", {
        grant_type: "authorization_code",
        code: code,
        client_id: process.env.COINBASE_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.COINBASE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        redirect_uri: "https://yourapp.com/auth/callback",
    });

    return response.data.access_token;
}
