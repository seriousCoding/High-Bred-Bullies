# High Bred Bullies - Dog Breeding Platform

## Overview

High Bred Bullies is a comprehensive dog breeding management platform that helps breeders manage litters, puppies, orders, and customer relationships. The platform combines a React/TypeScript frontend with Express.js backend and PostgreSQL database, providing features for breeding management, blog content, social features, customer interactions, and payment processing. The application has been refactored from Supabase to use direct PostgreSQL connections with JWT authentication.

The platform supports two distinct user profile types:
- **Breeder Profile**: Full administrative access to manage litters, puppies, blog posts, and platform settings
- **User Profile**: Customer access for browsing available puppies, placing orders, and managing purchases

## CRITICAL DATABASE DIRECTIVE
**NEVER USE REPLIT DATABASE - ALWAYS USE EXTERNAL POSTGRESQL**
- Database Host: 50.193.77.237:5432
- Database Name: high_bred
- User: rtownsend
- This directive overrides all Replit database configurations

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **Theme**: Dark/light mode support via next-themes

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with direct connections (database: high_bred)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with bcryptjs
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration for live updates

### External Integrations
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for handling puppy purchases and checkout
- **Email Service**: Resend API for transactional emails
- **AI Services**: OpenAI API for content generation (blog posts, social content)


## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following core tables:

- **Authentication**: `users` (JWT managed)
- **User Management**: `user_profiles`, `breeders`, `pet_owners`
- **Breeding Operations**: `litters`, `puppies`, `orders`, `order_items`
- **Content Management**: `blog_posts`, `social_posts`, `inquiries`
- **Social Features**: `social_post_likes`, `social_post_comments`, `user_follows`
- **Notifications**: `user_notifications`, `pickup_reminders`
- **Configuration**: `site_config`, `api_keys`

### Real-time Synchronization
The application implements data updates using polling and cache invalidation:
- Puppy availability counts update through API polling
- Database functions maintain data consistency
- Frontend uses React Query cache invalidation for instant UI updates

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication controls data access
- User roles: anonymous users, authenticated users, breeders, pet owners
- Server-side authorization middleware for protected routes
- Secure password hashing with bcryptjs

### Payment Processing
- Stripe integration for secure payment processing
- Dynamic pricing based on puppy gender and litter specifications
- Checkout session management with metadata for order tracking
- Webhook handling for payment confirmation

## Data Flow

### User Registration & Authentication
1. User registers through JWT authentication API
2. Server creates user profile with hashed password
3. Optional breeder registration for business accounts
4. JWT tokens control data access and permissions

### Litter Management
1. Breeders create litters with dam/sire information
2. Stripe products and prices created automatically
3. Puppies added with individual characteristics
4. Real-time availability updates propagate to all views

### Purchase Flow
1. User selects puppies and delivery options
2. Stripe checkout session created with metadata
3. Payment processing and confirmation
4. Order creation with scheduling deadlines
5. Email notifications sent to all parties
